Duplicate asset lines in map file

Duplicate asset lines in map file , u have to allow leading and traling spaces , any shape of map should work 
spaces are up to u to handle however u want.

this map should not work , the subject explecity says that u shhould parse the map before u pad it :

1. The Quote You Are Relying On
"Spaces are a valid part of the map and are up to you to handle." 

This means your program shouldn't crash or immediately return "Error" just because it sees a space. You shouldn't strip them out or ignore them during reading. You must store them or process them.

2. The Rule That Overrides It
"The map must be closed/surrounded by walls, if not the program must return an error." 

This is the hard constraint. In the logic of the game file:

1 is a Wall.

0 is Empty Space (Floor).

(Space) is Nothing/Void.

If you decide to "handle" spaces by turning them into 1s (Walls), you are effectively modifying the map to close it yourself. You are no longer checking if the map is closed; you are making it closed.

3. The "Parse As It Looks" Rule
"The map must be parsed as it looks in the file." 

If the file has a hole (a space) next to a zero, and you render a wall there, you are not parsing it as it looks. You are fixing the user's bad map.

The Correct Way to "Handle" Spaces
When the subject says "up to you to handle," it usually means you can decide how to represent them internally in your code (e.g., convert them to -1, 3, or keep them as ' '), provided that you treat them as non-walkable void.

The Logic Test: If a player is standing on a 0 and steps towards a (space):

Your interpretation: They hit a wall (because you turned space into 1).

Subject requirement: The map is invalid (not closed) because the 0 touches the "outside" world.

Verdict on Your Map
Your map has 0s touching spaces.

If you convert spaces to 1: The map works, but you fail the "Map must be closed" check because you forced it closed.

If you treat spaces as Void: The map returns Error, which is the correct behavior for that file.
